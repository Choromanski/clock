# Clock

Getting a Pico and a DCF77 receiver to power a handsome old clock

# Hardware

- DCF77
- Pi Pico
- Clock
- 24V power supply to run the clock and supply the pulse

# Code used

The DCF77 code was based on [demogorgi/set-rtc-using-dcf77-via-dcf1](https://github.com/demogorgi/set-rtc-using-dcf77-via-dcf1). It relies on a clean DCF77 signal, but is beautifully readable.
